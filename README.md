## Immersive Time

Why do your character have a digital clock at all times? Even when deep inside a cave with no concept of day or night. Would it not make more sense in a world like Outward to understand time based on the sun?

With this mod, you will never know "exactly" what time it is. You will see Morning, Evening etc on the map.
Questlog will also show flavor type of text like: "Day 4 Morning".
When you are inside (anything without a map). You will slowly lose track of time. The sundial will become less readable the longer you are inside.

I think many of never realise how much we look at the time when we play until it is not as clear.

This goes very well with a mod like True Hardcore where gates are locked during night.
```
Note: Timeslots like morning are already translated in the game. But the flavor text inside is not.
```
